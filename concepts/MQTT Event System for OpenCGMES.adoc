== Overview

This document describes the design and implementation of the MQTT Event System for OpenCGMES. The event system provides real-time notifications about changes in repositories, views, branches, and individual graphs, enabling reactive applications and workflows. The system uses the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for publishing and subscribing to events, leveraging its lightweight nature and publish/subscribe pattern to efficiently distribute notifications across distributed systems.

MQTT is particularly suitable for OpenCGMES because:

1. It provides a decoupled communication model where publishers and subscribers do not need to know about each other
2. It supports multiple quality of service (QoS) levels for different reliability requirements
3. It has low overhead, making it efficient for high-frequency events
4. It offers hierarchical topic structures that align well with the repository/view/branch/graph hierarchy in OpenCGMES

This document outlines the topic structure, event types, payload formats, and integration considerations for implementing the MQTT Event System in OpenCGMES.

The event system follows these key principles:

1. *Separation of Concerns*: The event publishing mechanism is separate from the core repository logic.

2. *Minimalism*: Events contain minimal but sufficient information, with references to resources rather than complete data.

3. *Consistency*: Event payloads follow a consistent structure across different event types.

4. *Idempotency*: Events are designed to be processed idempotently by subscribers.

5. *Hierarchy*: The topic structure mirrors the natural hierarchy of OpenCGMES components.

=== Topic Structure

The topic structure follows a hierarchical pattern that reflects the organization of data in OpenCGMES:

[source]
----
opencgmes/{component_type}/{component_id}/{event_type}
----

Where:

* `component_type`: The type of component generating the event (repository, view, branch, graph)
* `component_id`: The identifier for the specific component
* `event_type`: The specific event that occurred

This structure enables precise subscription patterns, allowing clients to subscribe to:

* All events in the system: `opencgmes/#`
* All events for a specific component type: `opencgmes/repository/#`
* All events for a specific component: `opencgmes/repository/instance/#`
* Specific event types for specific components: `opencgmes/branch/+/merged`

== Event Types

=== Repository Events

Repository events notify about changes to the core repositories in OpenCGMES:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description |Trigger
|`opencgmes/repositories/created` |Repository created |When a new repository is initialized
|`opencgmes/repositories/deleted` |Repository deleted |When a repository is removed from the system
|`opencgmes/repository/{repo_type}/graph/added` |Graph added to repository |When a new graph is added to a repository
|`opencgmes/repository/{repo_type}/graph/deleted` |Graph deleted from repository |When a graph is removed from a repository
|===

Where `{repo_type}` is one of: `schema`, `instance`, `header`, `shacl`

=== View Events

View events notify about changes to dataset views:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description |Trigger
|`opencgmes/views/created` |View created |When a new view is created
|`opencgmes/views/deleted` |View deleted |When a view is removed
|`opencgmes/view/{view_id}/graph/added` |Graph added to view |When a new graph is added to a view
|`opencgmes/view/{view_id}/graph/deleted` |Graph deleted from view |When a graph is removed from a view
|`opencgmes/view/{view_id}/validated` |View validated |When SHACL validation completes for a view
|===

=== Branch Events

Branch events notify about branch operations in the delta-based editing workflow:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description |Trigger
|`opencgmes/branches/created` |Branch created |When a new branch is created
|`opencgmes/branches/deleted` |Branch deleted |When a branch is deleted
|`opencgmes/branch/{view_id}/{branch_id}/merged` |Branch merged |When branches are merged
|`opencgmes/branch/{view_id}/{branch_id}/graph/added` |Graph added to branch |When a new graph is added to a branch
|`opencgmes/branch/{view_id}/{branch_id}/graph/deleted` |Graph deleted from branch |When a graph is removed from a branch
|`opencgmes/branch/{view_id}/{branch_id}/validated` |Branch validated |When SHACL validation completes for a branch
|===

=== Graph Events

Graph events notify about changes to individual graphs:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description |Trigger
|`opencgmes/graph/{repo_type}/{graph_id}/updated` |Graph updated |When a graph is modified
|===

== Event Payload Format

All events use a consistent JSON payload structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-16T14:24:36.123Z",
  "componentType": "repository|view|branch|graph",
  "componentId": "identifier-string",
  "eventType": "created|deleted|updated|added|validated|merged",
  "details": {
    // Event-specific details
  }
}
----

The `details` object contains additional event-specific information:

=== Example: Graph Added Event

[source,json]
----
{
  "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-16T14:24:36.123Z",
  "componentType": "repository",
  "componentId": "instance",
  "eventType": "graph/added",
  "details": {
    "graphId": "urn:uuid:71d4b744-3b84-40f0-b17f-9a49a82ff18a",
    "graphType": "cim:EQ",
    "sourceFile": "grid_model_2025.xml",
    "tripleCount": 15423
  }
}
----

=== Example: Branch Merged Event

[source,json]
----
{
  "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-16T15:30:22.456Z",
  "componentType": "branch",
  "componentId": "feature-x",
  "eventType": "merged",
  "details": {
    "viewId": "grid_model_2025.xml",
    "sourceBranch": "feature-x",
    "targetBranch": "main",
    "conflictsResolved": 3,
    "changesApplied": 42,
    "mergeCommitId": "m-12345abc"
  }
}
----

=== Example: Validation Event

[source,json]
----
{
  "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-16T17:22:33.123Z",
  "componentType": "view",
  "componentId": "grid_model_2025.xml",
  "eventType": "validated",
  "details": {
    "shaclFiles": ["EQ_452.rdf", "SSH_301.rdf"],

@enduml

=== Integration with Repository Operations

The event system integrates with repository operations through an aspect-oriented approach:

1. *Event Hooks*: Key methods in repositories, view managers, and branch managers are instrumented with event hooks.

2. *Asynchronous Publishing*: Events are published asynchronously to avoid blocking critical operations.

3. *Transaction Boundaries*: Events are published after transaction completion to ensure consistency.

=== Event Subscription Management

Clients can manage event subscriptions through:

1. *Direct MQTT Subscription*: Connecting directly to the MQTT broker using standard MQTT clients.

2. *REST API Subscription Management*: Using the REST API to create and manage subscriptions (which are then translated to MQTT subscriptions server-side).

3. *WebSocket Bridge*: For web clients, a WebSocket bridge can subscribe to MQTT topics and forward events to browser clients.

== Quality of Service Considerations

Different event types require different quality of service (QoS) levels:

[options="header"]
|===
|Event Category |Recommended QoS |Rationale
|Repository structure changes |QoS 2 (exactly once) |Critical changes that must not be missed or duplicated
|Branch operations |QoS 1 (at least once) |Important operations where processing twice is acceptable but not losing events
|Graph updates |QoS 0 or 1 |High-frequency events where occasional loss may be acceptable
|Validation results |QoS 1 |Important but resendable information
|System metrics |QoS 0 |High-frequency, low-criticality data
|===

== Broker Configuration and Management

=== Basic Configuration

The MQTT broker should be configured with:

1. *Authentication*: Username/password or certificate-based authentication
2. *Authorization*: Topic-level access control
3. *TLS/SSL*: Encrypted connections
4. *Persistence*: Durable message storage for disconnected clients

=== Topic Access Control

Example access control configuration:

[source]
----
# Administrator can access everything
user admin
topic readwrite opencgmes/#

# Viewer can only read
user viewer
topic read opencgmes/#

# Editor can read all and write to branches
user editor
topic read opencgmes/#
topic write opencgmes/branch/#
----

=== High Availability

For production environments:

1. *Clustered Brokers*: Multiple broker instances for redundancy
2. *Load Balancing*: Distribute client connections across broker instances
3. *Message Persistence*: Ensure messages are not lost during broker restarts

== Additional Event Types

=== Command Events

For fine-grained tracking of editing operations:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description
|`opencgmes/command/{view_id}/{branch_id}/executed` |Command executed in branch
|`opencgmes/command/{view_id}/{branch_id}/undone` |Command undone in branch
|`opencgmes/command/{view_id}/{branch_id}/redone` |Command redone in branch
|===

=== Query Events

For monitoring query patterns and performance:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description
|`opencgmes/query/{component_type}/{component_id}/executed` |SPARQL query executed
|`opencgmes/query/{component_type}/{component_id}/performance` |Query performance metrics
|===

=== Export Events

For tracking export operations:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description
|`opencgmes/export/{view_id}/{branch_id}/started` |Export operation started
|`opencgmes/export/{view_id}/{branch_id}/completed` |Export operation completed
|`opencgmes/export/{view_id}/{branch_id}/failed` |Export operation failed
|===

=== System Health Events

For monitoring system health:

[options="header"]
|===
|Topic Pattern |Description
|`opencgmes/system/health` |System health status
|`opencgmes/system/repository/{repo_type}/memory` |Repository memory usage
|`opencgmes/system/performance` |System performance metrics
|===

== Use Cases and Workflows

=== Real-Time UI Updates

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "OpenCGMES Server" as Server
participant "MQTT Broker" as Broker

User -> UI: Edit transformer parameters
UI -> Server: Submit edit (REST)
Server -> Server: Process edit
Server -> Broker: Publish graph update event
Broker -> UI: Push event via WebSocket
UI -> UI: Update visualization
User <- UI: See updated grid state
@enduml
----

This workflow enables real-time updates to the user interface without polling, creating a responsive and efficient user experience.

=== Collaborative Editing

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
actor "User A" as UserA
actor "User B" as UserB
participant "UI A" as UIA
participant "UI B" as UIB
participant "OpenCGMES Server" as Server
participant "MQTT Broker" as Broker

UserA -> UIA: Create branch "feature-x"
UIA -> Server: Create branch (REST)
Server -> Broker: Publish branch created event
Broker -> UIB: Push event
UIB -> UserB: Show notification

UserA -> UIA: Edit entity on "feature-x"
UIA -> Server: Submit edit (REST)
Server -> Broker: Publish graph update event
Broker -> UIB: Push event
UIB -> UserB: Show activity indicator

UserB -> UIB: Create branch "feature-y" from main
UIB -> Server: Create branch (REST)
Server -> Broker: Publish branch created event
Broker -> UIA: Push event
UIA -> UserA: Show notification

UserA -> UIA: Merge "feature-x" to main
UIA -> Server: Merge branch (REST)
Server -> Broker: Publish branch merged event
Broker -> UIB: Push event
UIB -> UserB: Show merge notification
@enduml
----

This workflow enables multiple users to work collaboratively on the same model, with real-time awareness of each other's activities.

=== Automated Validation

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "CI/CD System" as CI
participant "OpenCGMES Server" as Server
participant "MQTT Broker" as Broker
participant "Validation Service" as Validator

CI -> Server: Import model (REST)
Server -> Broker: Publish model imported event
Broker -> Validator: Push event

Validator -> Server: Run validation (REST)
Server -> Broker: Publish validation started event
Broker -> CI: Push event

Server -> Server: Perform validation
Server -> Broker: Publish validation completed event
Broker -> CI: Push event

alt Validation Failed
  CI -> CI: Block deployment
else Validation Passed
  CI -> CI: Proceed with deployment
end
@enduml
----

This workflow enables automated CI/CD pipelines that integrate validation of CGMES models as part of the deployment process.

== Restraints and Limitations

* The event system does not transmit complete model data in events, only references and metadata, to avoid excessive network traffic.
* Graph update events contain only version information and timestamps, not the actual delta changes.
* High-frequency events may be throttled or batched to prevent overwhelming subscribers.
* The MQTT broker is considered an external component that must be separately deployed and managed.

== Usage Examples

=== Subscribing to Events from Command Line

Using the Mosquitto command-line client:

[source,bash]
----
# Subscribe to all repository events
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -u opencgmes -P password -t "opencgmes/repository/#" -v

# Subscribe to branch merge events
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -u opencgmes -P password -t "opencgmes/branch/+/+/merged" -v

# Subscribe to all events for a specific model
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -u opencgmes -P password -t "opencgmes/+/grid_model_2025.xml/#" -v
----

=== JavaScript Client Example

Using the MQTT.js library:

[source,javascript]
----
const mqtt = require('mqtt');
const client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://localhost:1883', {
  username: 'opencgmes',
  password: 'password',
  clientId: 'ui-client-' + Math.random().toString(16).substr(2, 8)
});

client.on('connect', function () {
  // Subscribe to validation events
  client.subscribe('opencgmes/+/+/validated');
  
  // Subscribe to branch events for a specific model
  client.subscribe('opencgmes/branch/grid_model_2025.xml/#');
  
  console.log('Connected to MQTT broker');
});

client.on('message', function (topic, message) {
  const event = JSON.parse(message.toString());
  console.log('Received event:', topic, event);
  
  // Handle different event types
  if (topic.includes('/validated')) {
    updateValidationStatus(event);
  } else if (topic.includes('/branch/') && topic.includes('/merged')) {
    showMergeNotification(event);
  }
});

function updateValidationStatus(event) {
  // Update UI based on validation results
  if (event.details.conforms) {
    showSuccess('Validation passed!');
  } else {
    showError(`Validation failed with ${event.details.summary.violations} violations`);
  }
}

function showMergeNotification(event) {
  // Show notification about branch merge
  showNotification(`Branch ${event.details.sourceBranch} was merged into ${event.details.targetBranch}`);
}
----

== Conclusion

The MQTT Event System for OpenCGMES provides a flexible, efficient mechanism for real-time notifications about changes in the system. By following a consistent structure for topics and payloads, it enables diverse client applications to selectively subscribe to events of interest. This event-driven architecture facilitates reactive applications, real-time collaboration, and integration with external systems.

When implementing this system, special attention should be paid to:

1. Proper selection of QoS levels based on event criticality
2. Efficient event payload design to minimize network overhead
3. Secure configuration of the MQTT broker
4. Appropriate handling of high-frequency events

With these considerations in mind, the MQTT Event System can become a powerful foundation for building dynamic, collaborative applications on top of OpenCGMES.
