== ADR-001: Single CGMES Version Support Per Instance

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
The Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) has different versions, most notably CGMES 2.4.15 and CGMES 3.0, which use different XML namespaces:

* CGMES 2.4.15 uses namespace `http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#`
* CGMES 3.0 uses namespace `http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#`

Supporting multiple CGMES versions simultaneously within a single instance of OpenCGMES presents several challenges:

1. Different prefix mappings would be required for different versions, making it difficult to maintain a consistent "cim:" prefix across the system.
2. SPARQL queries would need to be version-aware, potentially requiring different queries for different CGMES versions.
3. Named graph patterns would become more complex if they needed to accommodate version-specific namespaces.
4. Code complexity would increase significantly with conditional logic to handle different namespace resolutions.

=== Decision
Each instance of OpenCGMES will support exactly one CGMES version at a time. Initially, the focus will be on CGMES 3.0, with CGMES 2.4.15 support considered as a separate implementation path later, based on community needs.

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Simplified prefix management with consistent "cim:" prefix usage
* Standardized SPARQL queries that work uniformly within an instance
* Cleaner codebase without conditional namespace handling
* Better performance without dynamic prefix resolution
* Focused development efforts on getting one version right before expanding

==== Negative
* Users needing to work with multiple CGMES versions will need to run multiple instances
* Migration between versions not inherently supported within a single instance
* Potentially some duplication of code between version-specific implementations

=== Implementation Notes
* Provide clear version selection mechanism during initialization
* Document this limitation clearly for users
* Consider developing utilities to assist with data migration between versions

== ADR-002: In-Memory Processing Model

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
CGMES data processing often involves large volumes of data that need to be accessed quickly for grid calculations and analysis. Traditional approaches using persistent storage like triple stores or databases might introduce performance bottlenecks for time-critical operations.

=== Decision
OpenCGMES will use an in-memory processing model with no persistence layer. All data, including RDF graphs, will be maintained in memory for maximum performance.

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Maximum performance for data access and queries
* Simplified architecture without database integration
* Reduced latency for time-critical operations
* Easier deployment without external database dependencies

==== Negative
* Higher memory consumption (estimated ~24GB RAM for European grid models for 24 hours)
* No built-in persistence between application restarts
* Potential limitations based on host system memory constraints

=== Implementation Notes
* Consider memory optimization techniques such as:
  ** Delta graphs for efficient storage of time series data
  ** String interning to reduce duplication
  ** Shared reference data across repositories
* Document memory requirements clearly for users

== ADR-003: Graph-Based Repository Structure

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
CGMES data is inherently graph-based, with complex relationships between different profile types (EQ, TP, SSH, DL, etc.). A well-organized repository structure is needed to manage these relationships while maintaining performance and clarity.

=== Decision
Implement a structured repository system with:

1. *Separate Repositories* for different types of data:
   * Schema Repository (read-only, containing all RDFS files)
   * Instance Repository (containing all instance data)
   * Header Repository (containing all header data)

2. *Named Graphs* following a specific pattern:
   * Profile Graphs: `cim:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
   * Schema Graphs: `cims:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
   * Header Graphs: `md:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`

3. *Internal Naming* simplified to use only `md:Model.mRID` for both instance and header repositories

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Clear separation of concerns between schema, instance, and header data
* Efficient profile-specific queries
* Organized structure that mirrors CGMES design
* Support for RDFS-enabled queries with inheritance awareness
* Easier validation with profile-specific rules

==== Negative
* More complex initial setup compared to a flat graph structure
* Learning curve for users unfamiliar with named graphs
* Additional overhead in graph management

=== Implementation Notes
* Implement union graph as a projection over separate instance graphs
* Ensure efficient cross-profile querying through the default graph
* Document naming conventions clearly for users

== ADR-004: SPARQL as Primary Query Interface

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
Accessing and analyzing CGMES data requires a powerful query interface that can handle complex graph traversals and data relationships. Various query approaches could be implemented, from custom APIs to standard query languages.

=== Decision
Use SPARQL as the primary query interface for OpenCGMES, with support for:

1. Named graph patterns for profile-specific queries
2. RDFS-enabled queries leveraging schema information
3. Union graph for cross-profile queries

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Leverages existing industry standard query language
* Powerful expressiveness for complex grid model queries
* Familiar to many users already working with RDF data
* Enables inheritance-aware queries using `rdfs:subClassOf*` patterns
* Consistent with RDF/CGMES ecosystem

==== Negative
* Steeper learning curve for users unfamiliar with SPARQL
* Potential performance considerations for very complex queries
* Less type safety compared to a strongly-typed API

=== Implementation Notes
* Provide example queries for common use cases
* Consider query optimization techniques
* Document best practices for efficient SPARQL usage

== ADR-005: Initial Focus on Read Operations

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
CGMES data can be read, validated, transformed, and modified. Each of these operations adds complexity to the implementation. A phased approach is needed to ensure solid foundations before adding more complex functionality.

=== Decision
Initially focus on read operations, validation, and transformation, with data manipulation via SPARQL Updates considered as a future extension.

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Simplifies initial implementation
* Ensures core functionality is solid before adding complexity
* Allows for thorough testing of read operations
* Aligns with immediate needs of most users

==== Negative
* Initial versions will have limited write capabilities
* Users needing to modify CGMES data will need to use alternative methods
* May require rework when adding update capabilities later

=== Implementation Notes
* Design repository structure with future update operations in mind
* Document the read-only nature of initial versions
* Plan for SPARQL Update support in roadmap

== ADR-006: API Layering Strategy

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
Different users and systems will need to interact with OpenCGMES in various ways, from direct library integration to remote service calls. A clear API strategy is needed to support these diverse use cases.

=== Decision
Implement a layered API approach:

1. Core Java API for direct programmatic access
2. REST API (planned) for remote access
3. gRPC interface (planned) for high-performance system integration
4. Client libraries (planned) for various programming languages

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Flexibility for different integration scenarios
* Support for diverse technology stacks
* Separation between core functionality and access methods
* Future-proofing for evolving integration needs

==== Negative
* Additional development effort to maintain multiple APIs
* Potential consistency challenges across different interfaces
* More complex testing requirements

=== Implementation Notes
* Design core functionality with API-agnostic approach
* Implement Java API first, then extend to REST and gRPC
* Consider auto-generation of client libraries where possible

== ADR-007: Schema-Aware Query Support

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
CGMES data follows complex schema definitions with inheritance hierarchies and property relationships. Queries can be made more powerful and flexible by leveraging this schema information.

=== Decision
Implement schema-aware query support that:

1. Includes schema graphs in query datasets
2. Enables inheritance-aware queries using `rdfs:subClassOf*` patterns
3. Provides access to property domain/range information
4. Makes data type information accessible

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* More powerful queries leveraging type hierarchies
* Simplified querying for complex class structures
* Better alignment with RDF/RDFS capabilities
* Reduced need for explicit type enumeration in queries

==== Negative
* Larger memory footprint with schema information loaded
* Potential performance impact for schema-heavy queries

=== Implementation Notes
* Ensure efficient loading and indexing of schema information
* Provide examples of schema-aware queries
* Consider optimization techniques for common inheritance patterns

== ADR-008: Simplified Graph Naming Convention

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
The initially proposed full internal naming convention for graphs (using `md:Model.modelingAuthoritySet | md:Model.scenarioTime | PROFILE_ABBREVIATION | md:Model.mRID`) introduces unnecessary complexity. This complexity becomes particularly problematic when considering validation and resolution of superseded and dependentOn model references in headers.

=== Decision
Simplify the internal naming to use only `md:Model.mRID` for both instance and header repositories:

1. *Separate Repositories* remain as before:
   * Schema Repository (read-only)
   * Instance Repository (containing instance data)
   * Header Repository (containing header data)

2. *Named Graphs* follow the pattern:
   * Profile Graphs: `cim:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
   * Schema Graphs: `cims:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
   * Header Graphs: `md:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`

3. *Internal Naming* simplified to use only `md:Model.mRID` as the unique identifier for both instance and header repositories

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Reduced complexity in the naming system
* Easier validation and resolution of model references
* Clearer framework for treating graphs as immutable in a read-only context
* Simplifies implementation and maintenance

==== Negative
* Less information encoded directly in the naming convention
* May require additional lookups to determine modeling authority and scenario time

=== Implementation Notes
* Ensure that modeling authority and scenario time information remains easily accessible
* Update dataset views to reflect the simplified naming convention
* Document the transition for any existing implementations

== ADR-009: Delta-Based Editing Model with Event Sourcing

=== Status
Draft (Under Review)

=== Context
CGMES models are identified by mRIDs, and any change to instance data invalidates the associated header. Traditional editing approaches would require generating new mRIDs for every edit, leading to challenges in maintaining consistency and tracking changes. Additionally, multi-user collaborative editing requires a mechanism for branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

=== Decision
Implement a delta-based editing model using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern with event sourcing that:

1. Treats original imported models as immutable baseline states
2. Records all changes as explicit delta operations (events) in an event store
3. Uses delta graphs as the foundation for representing changes
4. Provides views that apply sequences of deltas to baseline models
5. Supports branching and merging of edit streams
6. Only generates new mRIDs when publishing/exporting modified models
7. Implements optimistic locking for conflict detection during merges

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Preserves all original data and maintains complete edit history
* Enables efficient storage of changes without duplicating unchanged data
* Provides clear lineage and traceability between model versions
* Supports collaborative editing with branching and merging
* Allows for reverting changes or creating alternative scenarios
* Minimizes the need for new mRID generation during the editing process

==== Negative
* Increased complexity in the overall system architecture
* Performance considerations for nested delta graphs buildung long chains
* Additional tooling required for effective conflict resolution

=== Implementation Notes
* Design a clean command API for recording edit operations
* Implement efficient delta storage and retrieval mechanisms
* Develop clear conflict detection and resolution strategies
* Document the branching and merging model for users


== ADR-010: API Versioning Strategy

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
As OpenCGMES develops REST and gRPC APIs for external access, a clear strategy for API versioning is needed to ensure:

1. Backward compatibility for existing clients as the API evolves
2. Clear expectations for API consumers regarding stability and changes
3. Flexibility to introduce breaking changes when necessary
4. Maintainable codebase without excessive version-specific code paths

The need for versioning arises from the reality that APIs evolve over time as requirements change, bugs are fixed, and new features are added. However, once an API is published and in use by clients, changes can potentially break those clients. A versioning strategy helps manage this evolution while minimizing disruption.

=== Decision
Implement a path-based versioning strategy for all OpenCGMES APIs:

1. *URL Path Versioning*: Include the major version number in the base URL path
   * Example: `/api/v1/model/{filename}/query`

2. *Version Lifecycles*:
   * Major versions (v1, v2) indicate potentially breaking changes
   * Minor versions are documented but don't change the URL path
   * Patch versions address bugs without changing behavior

3. *Version Support Policy*:
   * At least two major versions will be supported simultaneously
   * Deprecated versions will have a minimum 6-month sunset period
   * Version deprecation announcements will be clearly communicated

4. *Documentation*:
   * Each version will have separate, complete API documentation
   * Migration guides will be provided between major versions
   * Changelog will track all changes, including minor and patch updates

=== Consequences

==== Positive
* Clear indication of API version in URLs makes it obvious which version a client is using
* Ability to introduce breaking changes in new major versions while maintaining backward compatibility
* Simplified routing and request handling in the implementation
* Consistent approach across all API endpoints
* Developer-friendly as the version is visible in all API references

==== Negative
* Potential duplication of code for supporting multiple API versions simultaneously
* Requires disciplined documentation of changes between versions
* Additional maintenance burden for supporting multiple versions during transition periods
* Client applications need to explicitly update URLs when migrating versions

=== Implementation Notes
* Use Spring RequestMapping at the controller class level to specify version prefix
* Consider leveraging interface inheritance for version compatibility where appropriate
* Implement API monitoring to track usage by version for deprecation planning
* Document version differences in OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
* Consider using feature flags for new capabilities that might eventually span versions

= ADR-011: Event System Architecture for OpenCGMES
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:sectnums:
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Status
Accepted

== Context
OpenCGMES needs a mechanism to notify external systems about changes to repositories, views, branches, and graphs. These notifications are essential for enabling:

1. Real-time UI updates without polling
2. Multi-user collaborative editing
3. Integration with external monitoring and validation systems
4. Event-based automation workflows
5. Audit and activity tracking

Several approaches could be used to implement this notification system:

1. Webhook callbacks
2. Long polling
3. WebSockets
4. Server-sent events (SSE)
5. Message queues
6. Publish/subscribe messaging

Each approach has different characteristics regarding scalability, reliability, ease of implementation, and client compatibility.

== Decision
Implement an event notification system using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) as the primary transport protocol, with the following architecture:

1. *Protocol*: MQTT 3.1.1 or 5.0
2. *Broker*: External MQTT broker (e.g., Eclipse Mosquitto)
3. *Topic Structure*: Hierarchical, reflecting OpenCGMES component structure:
   ```
   # For existing resources:
   opencgmes/{component_type}/{component_id}/{event_type}
   
   # For creation/deletion events (using plural component types):
   opencgmes/{component_types}/created
   opencgmes/{component_types}/deleted
   ```
4. *Event Format*: JSON with standardized structure
5. *Event Storage*: No persistent event storage within OpenCGMES; rely on broker capabilities
6. *Client Access*: Direct MQTT connections plus WebSocket bridge for web clients

This decision includes the restraint that OpenCGMES will *not* implement its own MQTT broker but will provide documentation and configuration examples for using external brokers.

== Consequences

=== Positive
* **Decoupled Architecture**: Publishers and subscribers don't need direct knowledge of each other.
* **Efficient Protocol**: MQTT is lightweight and designed for constrained environments.
* **Flexible Subscriptions**: Hierarchical topics allow precise subscription patterns.
* **Scalability**: MQTT brokers are designed to handle thousands of clients and high message throughput.
* **QoS Options**: Different quality of service levels can be used for different event types.
* **Wide Adoption**: Many client libraries and tools exist for different platforms.
* **Real-time Performance**: Low latency for event delivery.

=== Negative
* **External Dependency**: Requires deploying and managing an external MQTT broker.
* **Operational Complexity**: Adds another component to the deployment architecture.
* **Limited Querying**: No built-in capabilities for historical event querying.
* **Security Management**: Requires careful configuration of authentication and authorization.
* **Connection State**: Requires handling reconnections and potential message loss.

=== Implementation Notes
* Implement a clean abstraction layer to isolate MQTT-specific code.
* For web clients, provide a WebSocket bridge that subscribes to MQTT topics and forwards events.
* Consider adding a REST API for subscription management to simplify client integration.
* Document broker setup and security best practices.
* Ensure event payloads are self-contained and include all necessary context.
* Implement QoS selection based on event criticality.

== Implementation Architecture

The event system consists of several components:

1. *Event Publishers*: Components that capture system events and publish them to the MQTT broker.
2. *Event Broker*: External MQTT broker that routes messages from publishers to subscribers.
3. *Event Subscribers*: External systems that subscribe to events of interest.
4. *WebSocket Bridge*: Optional component to support web clients.

== Alternative Approaches Considered

=== WebHooks
* **Pros**: Simple HTTP-based integration, familiar to many developers
* **Cons**: Requires client to expose HTTP endpoints, stateless, can't push to browsers directly

=== WebSockets
* **Pros**: Full-duplex communication, well-supported in browsers
* **Cons**: Higher resource usage for maintaining connections, less suitable for IoT/lightweight clients

=== Server-Sent Events (SSE)
* **Pros**: Simple client implementation, works with standard HTTP
* **Cons**: One-way communication, potential issues with proxies and firewalls

=== Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)
* **Pros**: Robust delivery guarantees, complex routing capabilities
* **Cons**: Heavier protocol overhead, potentially more complex client implementations

== Future Considerations

1. *Correlation IDs*: Add support for tracking related events across system components.
2. *Event Schemas*: Define formal schemas for event payloads to ensure compatibility.
3. *Metrics and Monitoring*: Add instrumentation for event system performance.
