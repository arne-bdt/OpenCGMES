== Core Design Principles

=== Version Support Strategy
* Target CGMES 3.0 initially
** Focus on getting a solid foundation with the latest standard
** This approach allows for cleaner code without legacy support burden
** CGMES 3.0 uses namespace `http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#`
* CGMES 2.4.15 support will be considered later based on community needs
** Would require namespace handling for `http://iec.ch/TC57/2013/CIM-schema-cim16#`
* Clear separation of code that handles version-specific features through abstraction layers

== Data Ingestion

=== Input Formats
* Individual CGMES profile files (XML/RDF)
* ZIP packages containing multiple CGMES profile files
* Automatic detection of contained profiles based on RDF schema references

=== Processing Steps
1. Parse and load files into in-memory representation
2. Extract profile information
3. Create namespace mappings based on detected CGMES version
4. Organize into separate graph structures based on profile types
5. Link to appropriate schema definitions

== Graph Structure

=== Graph Hierarchy

==== Repository Level
* Two main repositories maintained by the system:
** Schema Repository: Contains all RDF schema definitions (read-only)
** Instance Repository: Contains all instance data
** Heder Repository: Contains all header data

==== Dataset Level
* Datasets are "views" over the repositories
* Each dataset corresponds to an input file or ZIP package
* Dataset name derived from input filename

==== Graph Level
* Multiple named graphs within each dataset
* Separate graph for each profile type
* Schema graphs, instance graphs, and header graphs clearly separated

=== Naming Conventions in Detail

==== Profile Graphs for Instance Data
* Named using pattern: `cim:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
** Examples:
*** For Equipment profile: `cim:EQ`
*** For Topology profile: `cim:TP`
*** For Steady State Hypothesis profile: `cim:SSH`
*** For Diagram Layout profile: `cim:DL`
* Full internal naming for instance data repository: `md:Model.mRID`
** Example: `urn:uuid:71d4b744-3b84-40f0-b17f-9a49a82ff18a`


==== Schema Graphs
* Named using pattern: `cims:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
** Examples:
*** For Equipment profile schema: `cims:EQ`
*** For Topology profile schema: `cims:TP`
* Full internal naming for instance data repository: file name of the schema file
** Examples for Equipment profile schema:
*** in CGMES 3.0: `IEC61970-600-2_CGMES_3_0_0_RDFS2020_EQ.rdf`
*** in CGMES 2.4.15: `EquipmentProfileCoreOperationShortCircuitRDFSAugmented-v2_4_15-4Sep2020.rdf`
** Examples for  Steady State Hypothesis profile schema
*** in CGMES 3.0: `IEC61970-600-2_CGMES_3_0_0_RDFS2020_SSH.rdf`
*** in CGMES 2.4.15: `SteadyStateHypothesisProfileRDFSAugmented-v2_4_15-4Sep2020.rdf`

==== Header Graphs
* Named using pattern: `md:PROFILE_ABBREVIATION`
** Examples:
*** For Equipment profile header: `md:EQ`
*** For Topology profile header: `md:TP`
* Full internal naming for instance data repository: `md:Model.mRID`


=== Profile Abbreviation Discovery

==== For CGMES 3.0
* Abbreviation found in `<dcat:keyword>` of the `http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Ontology` object
* Example from the Diagram Layout RDFS file:

[source,xml]
----
<rdf:Description rdf:about = "http://iec.ch/TC57/ns/CIM/DiagramLayout-EU#Ontology">
    <owl:backwardCompatibleWith rdf:resource="http://iec.ch/TC57/61970-453/DiagramLayout/2/1"/>
    <dcat:keyword>DL</dcat:keyword>
    <owl:incompatibleWith rdf:resource="http://entsoe.eu/2009/profile1"/>
    <!-- ... other properties ... -->
</rdf:Description>
----

==== For CGMES 2.4.15
* Abbreviation found in `<cims:isFixed>` with pattern: "The name of the class shall be the name of the profile + 'Version'." + `.shortName`
* Example from Diagram Layout RDFS file:

[source,xml]
----
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://entsoe.eu/CIM/SchemaExtension/3/1#DiagramLayoutVersion.shortName">
    <cims:stereotype rdf:resource="http://iec.ch/TC57/NonStandard/UML#attribute"/>
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">shortName</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="http://entsoe.eu/CIM/SchemaExtension/3/1#DiagramLayoutVersion"/>
    <cims:dataType rdf:resource="#String"/>
    <cims:multiplicity rdf:resource="http://iec.ch/TC57/1999/rdf-schema-extensions-19990926#M:1..1" />
    <cims:isFixed rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">DL</cims:isFixed>
    <rdfs:comment rdf:parseType="Literal">The short name of the profile used in profile documentation.</rdfs:comment>
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property"/>
</rdf:Description>

== Repository Implementation

=== Schema Repository
* Read-only repository containing all RDFS files
* Singleton instance shared across the application
* Graphs named after schema files for direct reference
* Provides schema information for RDFS-aware queries
* Enables inheritance hierarchies via `rdfs:subClassOf`

=== Instance Repository
* Contains all instance data from CGMES files
* Graph naming is using the md:Model.mRID
* Each instance has exactly one header (stored in separate graph in the header repository)
* Repository enables efficient storage and retrieval of models

=== Header Repository
* Contains header data for each model
* Graph naming is using the md:Model.mRID
* Enables quick access to metadata without loading full model data


== SPARQL Dataset Design

=== Dataset Creation
* One dataset created per imported file/package
* Dataset name derived from the provided file name
* Dataset is a "view" over the repositories, not a copy of the data
* Creation process:
  1. Analyze input file(s) to identify contained profiles
  2. Identify corresponding schema definitions
  3. Create named graph mappings
  4. Configure the union graph

=== Graph Organization Rationale
* Separate named graphs for each profile improves:
  ** Query performance (only access relevant graphs)
  ** Data organization (clear separation of concerns)
  ** Validation scenarios (profile-specific rules)
* Default graph as a union of all separate graphs enables:
  ** Compatibility with simple queries that don't use GRAPH patterns
  ** Cross-profile validation
  ** Simpler querying for users unfamiliar with named graphs

=== Union Graph Implementation
* Union graph is a projection which dynamically iterates over separate instance graphs
* Not a physical copy of data, but a logical view
* Implemented as a read-only union view to prevent inconsistencies

=== RDFS-Enabled Queries
* Schema inclusion enables inheritance-aware queries
* Support for queries using `rdfs:subClassOf*` patterns
* Property domain/range information available
* Data type information accessible

=== Modeing Authority Set (MAS) Filtering
* Ability to filter views based on MAS identifiers
* Dataset views can be constrained to specific MAS or list of MAS values
* Enables querying across specific TSOs without changing query structure
* When multiple MAS values are present, header data graphs are excluded

=== Example Queries

==== Basic Query Using Named Graphs

This query fetches transformer end information with tap changer positions, using the appropriate named graphs:

[source,sparql]
----
SELECT ?trafoEndMrid 
       ?transformerName 
       ?tapChanger ?tapChangerName ?tapChangerPosition      
FROM NAMED <cim:EQ>
FROM NAMED <cim:SSH>
WHERE 
{
    GRAPH <cim:EQ> { 
        ?trafoEndMrid 
            a cim:PowerTransformerEnd;
            cim:PowerTransformerEnd.PowerTransformer/cim:IdentifiedObject.name ?transformerName.
        optional {        
            ?trafoEndMrid ^(cim:RatioTapChanger.TransformerEnd | cim:PhaseTapChanger.TransformerEnd) ?tapChanger.
            ?tapChanger cim:IdentifiedObject.name ?tapChangerName. 
            GRAPH <cim:SSH> {    
                ?tapChanger cim:TapChanger.step ?tapChangerPosition.
            }
        }
    }    
}
----

==== Query Using Type Inheritance (Schema-Aware)

This query uses the schema information to find all switch instances, including subtypes like Breaker, Disconnector, etc.:

[source,sparql]
----
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT ?switchMrid ?switchName ?switchType
FROM NAMED <cim:EQ>
FROM NAMED <cims:EQ>
WHERE {
    GRAPH <cims:EQ> {
        ?switchType rdfs:subClassOf* cim:Switch .
    }
    
    GRAPH <cim:EQ> {
        ?switchMrid a ?switchType;
                   cim:IdentifiedObject.name ?switchName.
    }
}
----

==== Query Using Default Union Graph

This query works without named GRAPH patterns, relying on the default union graph:

[source,sparql]
----
SELECT ?bus ?busName ?voltage
WHERE {
    ?bus a cim:BusbarSection;
         cim:IdentifiedObject.name ?busName;
         cim:ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage ?voltage.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?voltage)
----

== Memory Management Considerations

=== In-Memory Processing
* All data maintained in memory for maximum performance
* No persistence layer or triple store required
* Suitable for large-scale models (later):
  ** European grid models for 24 hours could fit in ~24GB RAM
  ** Delta graph techniques could be used to reduce memory footprint

== Future Extensions

Prioritized list of features planned for future development:

=== Difference Model Support
* Support for CGMES difference models planned for later phases
* Will enable efficient updates to existing models
* Implementation will follow after core functionality is stable

=== API Extensions
* REST API for remote access
* gRPC interface for high-performance system integration
* Client libraries for various programming languages

=== SHACL Validation (later)
* Support for profile-specific validation rules
* Cross-profile validation enabled by the union graph
* ENTSO-E published SHACL files supported
* Validation results provided in standard formats

=== Memory Optimization (later)
* Delta graphs used to efficiently store time series data
* Only differences between time points stored, not full copies
* Reference data (like schema definitions) shared across repositories
* Efficient string interning to reduce duplication

=== Conversion Capabilities (later)
* JSON-LD conversion for modern API integrations
* Standardized output formats following emerging standards
* CGMES-specific serialization rules respected
