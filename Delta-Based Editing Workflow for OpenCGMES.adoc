== Overview

This document describes the user workflow and internal architecture for implementing delta-based editing of CGMES models in OpenCGMES. The approach uses CQRS with event sourcing to enable collaborative editing while maintaining data integrity and traceability.

== Restraints

A fully fledged CQRS-store shall not be implmented in OpenCGMES. The current implementation is a simplified version of CQRS with event sourcing, without persisting the events. The events are only used to generate the delta models in-memory.
There are commercial solutions for the persistence of RDF graphs, delta-graphs and events. (for example the `RICO-RDF-Core` from https://www.soptim.de[SOPTIM AG])

== User Workflow

=== 1. Import and Baseline Creation

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
skinparam activityFontSize 14
skinparam noteFontSize 12

start
:User imports CGMES model file(s);
:System registers model in Instance Repository;
:System extracts header to Header Repository;
:System creates new Baseline Version;
note right: Original mRIDs preserved
:User receives confirmation of successful import;
stop
@enduml
----

When a user imports CGMES model files, the system:

1. Parses the files and loads them into the Instance Repository with original mRIDs preserved
2. Extracts the header information to the Header Repository
3. Records this as a baseline version (immutable starting point)
4. Makes this model available for viewing and querying

=== 2. Starting an Edit Session

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
skinparam activityFontSize 14
skinparam noteFontSize 12

start
:User selects a model to edit;
:User creates new branch (or uses main);
note right: Branch has unique ID
:System creates an edit session;
:System initializes empty delta graphs for this branch in the edit repository;
:User receives an editable view of current model state;
stop
@enduml
----

To begin editing:

1. User selects a model from the repository
2. User creates a new named branch (or uses the main branch)
3. System creates an edit session with a unique session ID
4. System initializes empty delta graphs for this branch in the edit repository 
5. User works with a delta view that initially matches the baseline

=== 3. Making Edits

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
skinparam activityFontSize 14
skinparam noteFontSize 12

start
:User performs edit operation;
:System converts edit to command;
:System validates command;

if (Valid command?) then (yes)
  :System records command as event;
  :System applies delta to view;
  :User sees updated model view;
else (no)
  :System rejects edit;
  :User notified of validation error;
endif
stop
@enduml
----

During editing:

1. User performs edits through the UI (e.g., modifying equipment parameters, adding/removing components)
2. Each edit is converted to a command (e.g., `ModifyTransformerRatioCommand`, `AddBreakpointCommand`)
3. System validates the command against business rules and CGMES schema
4. If valid, the command is:
   a. Recorded as an event in the delta stream for this branch
   b. Applied to the delta graphs in the edit repository
   c. Reflected immediately in the user's view
5. If invalid, the edit is rejected with appropriate feedback

=== 4. Branching and Collaboration

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
skinparam activityFontSize 14
skinparam noteFontSize 12

start
:User A creates a branch "feature-X";
:User A makes edits on branch "feature-X";

fork
  :User B creates branch "feature-Y" from main;
  :User B makes different edits;
fork again
  :User A continues editing "feature-X";
end fork

:Later, User B wants to incorporate User A's changes;
:User B merges branch "feature-X" into "feature-Y";

if (Conflicts?) then (yes)
  :System identifies conflicts;
  :User B resolves conflicts manually;
else (no)
  :Automatic merge succeeds;
endif

:Both users continue with merged state;
stop
@enduml
----

For collaborative editing:

1. Multiple users can create branches from any baseline or existing branch
2. Each branch maintains its own delta stream
3. Users can periodically merge changes between branches
4. During merges, the system:
   a. Identifies conflicting deltas (e.g., both modified the same transformer)
   b. Auto-resolves non-conflicting changes
   c. Presents conflicts to users for manual resolution
5. The result is a new combined delta stream

=== 5. Exporting Modified Models

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
skinparam activityFontSize 14
skinparam noteFontSize 12

start
:User finalizes edits;
:User initiates export;
:System validates complete model;

if (Valid model?) then (yes)
  :System generates new mRIDs for changed elements;
  :System creates new model header with dependencies;
  note right: References original model\nas dependency or superseded
  :System exports CGMES files;
  :User receives exported files;
else (no)
  :System shows validation errors;
  :User addresses issues;
endif
stop
@enduml
----

When exporting:

1. User finalizes edits and initiates an export operation
2. System validates the complete model against CGMES rules
3. If valid, the system:
   a. Generates new mRIDs for changed elements
   b. Creates a new model header with appropriate references:
      - `dependentOn` relationships to unchanged profiles
      - `supersedes` relationships to changed profiles
   c. Exports the model as standard CGMES files
   d. The exported model is copied to the header and instance 
      repositories and a new view is created
4. If invalid, validation errors are presented for correction

== Internal Architecture

=== Repository Structure

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
package "Read Model" {
  [Schema Repository] as SchemaRepo
  [Instance Repository] as InstanceRepo
  [Header Repository] as HeaderRepo
  [Edit Repository] as EditRepo
}

package "Write Model" {
  [Command Processor] as CmdProc
  [Event Store] as EventStore
  [Branch Manager] as BranchMgr
}

package "Services" {
  [Dataset View Service] as DatasetSvc
  [SPARQL Service] as SparqlSvc
  [Edit Session Service] as EditSvc
  [Export Service] as ExportSvc
  [Merge Service] as MergeSvc
}

SchemaRepo <-- DatasetSvc
InstanceRepo <-- DatasetSvc
HeaderRepo <-- DatasetSvc
EditRepo <-- DatasetSvc
DatasetSvc <-- SparqlSvc

CmdProc --> EventStore
BranchMgr --> EventStore

EditSvc --> CmdProc
EditSvc --> BranchMgr
EditSvc --> EditRepo
MergeSvc --> BranchMgr
MergeSvc --> EditRepo
ExportSvc --> EditRepo
ExportSvc --> HeaderRepo
ExportSvc --> InstanceRepo

The system implements CQRS by dividing into:

1. *Read Model*:
   * Schema Repository - Stores RDFS schemas (immutable)
   * Instance Repository - Stores baseline instance data (immutable)
   * Header Repository - Stores baseline headers (immutable)
   * Edit Repository - Stores editable delta graphs

2. *Write Model*:
   * Command Processor - Validates and processes edit commands
   * Event Store - Records all edit events in sequence
   * Branch Manager - Handles branch creation and merging

=== Graph and Dataset Organization

==== Graphs
* *Instance, header and edit repository Graphs*: `Model.mRID`
  * Example: `urn:uuid:71d4b744-3b84-40f0-b17f-9a49a82ff18a`

==== Dataset Views
* *Baseline Dataset*: Original imported model
  * Contains baseline instance and header graphs with original mRIDs
  * View name is the file name
* *Branch Dataset*: Editable branch of an imported model
  * Contains delta graphs based on baseline
  * View name is the branch name
* *Export Dataset*: Final version for export
  * Is the export of branch dataset with new Model.mRIDs 
    and headers into a baseline dataset

=== Delta Generation and Application (Theoretical Overview)

The system handles deltas through:

1. *Command Recording*:
   * Each edit command is recorded as an event
   * Events contain:
     - Command type (Add/Modify/Remove)
     - Target resource mRID
     - Property path
     - Old value (for modify/remove)
     - New value (for add/modify)
     - Timestamp and user information

2. *Delta Generation*:
   * Events are transformed into CGMES difference models
   * Difference models use standard CGMES constructs:
     - `rdf:about` for identifying modified resources
     - Regular property assertions for new values

3. *Snapshot Process*:
   * Baseline model loaded
   * Deltas applied in sequence to create current view
   * Working mRIDs used during editing
   * New final mRIDs generated only during export

=== Conflict Resolution (conceptual)

During merges:

1. *Conflict Detection*:
   * System compares delta streams from different branches
   * Identifies when both streams modified the same resource+property
   * Creates a conflict record with both values

2. *Conflict Resolution Strategies*:
   * Auto-resolution for non-conflicting changes
   * Manual resolution UI for conflicting changes
   * Options to: 
     - Take "mine" (current branch)
     - Take "theirs" (merging branch)
     - Create new value
     - Accept both (where applicable)

3. *Resolution Recording*:
   * Resolution decisions recorded as special merge events
   * Complete audit trail maintained

== Export Process in Detail

The export process is particularly important as it bridges the internal delta-based editing with standard CGMES:

1. *Consistency Validation* (optional):
   * Complete model validation against CGMES rules
   * Cross-profile reference checking
   * Business rule validation

2. *mRID Management*:
   * Generate new mRIDs for modified resources
   * Maintain original mRIDs for unchanged resources
   * Update references to maintain consistency

3. *Header Generation*:
   * Create new CGMES-compliant headers with:
     - New model mRID for each modified profile
     - `dependentOn` references to unchanged profiles
     - `supersedes` references to original versions for modified profiles
     - Proper modeling authority set and timestamps

4. *Build Basline Model*:
   * Create new entries in the instance and header repositories
   * Create new view

5. *Serialization*:
   * Serailizatin should be available to all views.
   * Convert model to standard CGMES XML format
   * Package profiles according to CGMES standards
   * Include generated headers
   * Create individual files or ZIP package based on user preference

== Implementation Considerations

=== User Experience (ideas)

1. *Real-time Collaboration*:
   * Live updates of branch status
   * Notification of merge opportunities

2. *Visual Diff Tools*:
   * Graphical representation of changes
   * Network diagram with highlighted changes

3. *Simplified Branching UI*:
   * Branch visualization and management
   * Merge previews and conflict indicators
